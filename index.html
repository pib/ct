Bookmark the following link: <a href="javascript:_ctf='Austin, TX',(typeof _ctcct)[0]=='f'?_ctcct:function(){var d=document,s=d.createElement('script');s.type='text/javascript';s.src='http://p1b.us/ct/ct.js?'+(Math.random());d.body.appendChild(s)}();">Find distance</a>

<p>
  Then edit the bookmark and replace the 'Austin, TX' bit with the
  address of where you work.
</p>
<p>
  Now going to a Trulia/Zillow/Realtor.com(any site which uses
  schema.org PostalAddress schema) real estate page and clicking on
  that bookmarklet will tell you how long of a commute you would have
  between the property you are viewing and your work address.
